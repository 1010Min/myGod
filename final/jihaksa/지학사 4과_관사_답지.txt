On the street
 After school, Wei’s family took me to (a) restaurant nearby. According to Wei, it is very common in China to eat out. Though the smell of the spices in the restaurant was unusual to me, I quite enjoyed the food. The amount was huge. The table was very big and round, and spun around at the center, which made it easy to share the dishes. I was told that customers must take any left over food with them.
 After the meal, we walked along the main street. Most of the signs on the stores were red. Food stands sold very interesting food such as fried bugs. I took (a) bite of (a) bug, and surprisingly the taste was pretty good. I also bought (a) bottle of cola. It was 888 ml, which was quite (a) strange quantity to me. The number 8 has long been regarded as the luckiest number in Chinese culture because the sound of it is linked to the meaning of making (a) fortune.
