Why Riddles?
 Lots of people enjoy riddles because they offer (a) chance to think in fun ways. The answers to riddles are rarely obvious. To solve (a) riddle, you have to think creatively. You need to collect clues and think outside the box. Try this riddle, for example: "I am lighter than (a) feather, but no one can hold me for long. What am I?" Do you know the answer? There are two useful clues: something lighter than (a) feather and possible meanings of the word "hold." If you combine the clues and think hard, you may be able to figure out the answer, "breath." Your breath is obviously lighter than (a) feather, and you cannot hold or stop it for long. Now, see if you can solve another riddle: "There is (a) green house. Inside the green house there is (a) white house. Inside the white house there is (a) red house. Inside the red house there are lots of babies. What is it?”
