Early Maps 
The earliest surviving map of the world is preserved on (a/an) clay tablet made in ancient Babylonia in about 6th century B.C. It represents the earth as (a/an) flat circle with oceans and mythical islands around it. The European maps made during the Middle Ages were heavily influenced by religious views. For example, (a/an) map of the world created in the 6th century shows that the world is flat, and the heavens are shaped like (a/an) box with (a/an) curved lid. All of these early maps were, of course, drawn and illustrated by hand.
The invention of printing made maps much more widely available in the 15th century. Map-making skills advanced during the Age of Exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries. Coast lines, islands, rivers, and harbors were described on maps. Compass lines and other navigation aids were included, and new map projections were devised. People at the time had the belief that such maps had great value for military and economic purposes and often treated them as national or commercial secrets. Whole-world maps that resemble those of today began to appear in the early 16th century, following voyages by Columbus and others to the New World.
