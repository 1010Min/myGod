My trip to Venice would not be complete without (a) gondola ride along the Grand Canal, which snakes through the city in (a) large S shape. I was disappointed to find out the fare to ride the Grand Canal by myself was so expensive that I could not afford it. The moment I was turning back, I saw my British tourist friends walking toward the ticket office. We shared the fare and we commented on the unique differences of the buildings along the canal. We had (a) nice chat, took some great pictures, and exchanged email addresses before we got off the gondola.
